# Traffic Detection Project

Welcome to the Traffic Detection Project repository! This project leverages advanced machine learning models, specifically YOLOv5 and YOLOv8, to detect and analyze traffic patterns efficiently. Below is a detailed guide to help you get started with the project.

## Project Structure

### Notebooks:

- **AI_Project_Code_YOLOv5.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for traffic detection using the YOLOv5 model.
- **AI_Project_Code_YOLOv8.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for traffic detection using the YOLOv8 model.
- **AI_Project_Code_YOLOv8_v2.ipynb**: Updated version of the YOLOv8 model notebook.

### Documentation:

- **2024070910 (1).pdf**: Comprehensive documentation detailing the project's outcomes and methodologies.
- **NON-48.pdf**: Additional reports related to the project's findings.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook

#### Required Libraries: Install these via pip
```bash
pip install torch opencv-python
```

### Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine to begin working with the traffic detection notebooks:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jinalthakkar7/Traffic-Detection.git
```

### Running the Notebooks

Navigate to the cloned directory:

```bash
cd Traffic-Detection
```

Start Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

In the Jupyter Notebook interface, open the notebook corresponding to the version of YOLO you wish to run:

- For YOLOv5, open `AI_Project_Code_YOLOv5.ipynb`.
- For YOLOv8, open `AI_Project_Code_YOLOv8.ipynb` or `AI_Project_Code_YOLOv8_v2.ipynb`.
